 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students
            select * from students;
 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)
            select * from teachers
            where subject = "Math";
 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher
            select
            s.first_name as Student_First_Name,
            s.last_name as Student_Last_Name,
            s.email as Student_Email,
            t.first_name as Teacher_First_Name,
            t.last_name as Teacher_Last_Name
            from students s
            join teachers_students ts
            on s.id = ts.student_id
            join teachers t
            on ts.teacher_id = t.id
            where t.id = 1;
 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject
             select
             s.first_name as Student_First_Name,
             s.last_name as Student_Last_Name,
             s.email as Student_Email,
             c.name as Course_name
             from students s
             join students_courses cs
             on s.id = cs.student_id
             join courses c
             on cs.course_id = c.id
             where c.name = 'design';

 *          e. update a record in the student table
            UPDATE `college`.`students` SET `first_name` = 'Raffy', `last_name` = 'Devers', `email` = 'r.devers@rs.com' WHERE (`id` = '4');

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
            INSERT INTO `college`.`teachers` (`id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `subject`) VALUES ('6', 'Chris', 'Martin', 'PE');

 *
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
