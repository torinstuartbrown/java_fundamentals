/*
*  MySQL Exercise 4:
*
*   Now that you have mastered your air travel database, it's time to connect this DB to a Java application
*   using JDBC. You can start simple here and build your way up. Within a Java application, using JDBC, please
*   demonstrate how to:
*
*   Note: CRUD means (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
*
*       1.) CRUD new flights
*       2.) CRUD new passengers
*       3.) Bonus: flex those JDBC muscles! How nice, clean, useful can you make this? Show us what you've got!
