            λ git init
            Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/torin/CN/git_practice/.git/
        b. Make new file

        C:\Users\torin\CN\git_practice (master)
        λ touch ex2file.txt

        c. Add file

        C:\Users\torin\CN\git_practice (master)
        λ git add ex2file.txt

        d. Commit file

        [master (root-commit) 9525f9f] commiting file for ex2
         1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

            git remote add <ANY_NAME> <URL_OF_NEW_GITHUB_REPO.git>

            C:\Users\torin\CN\git_practice (master)
            λ   git remote add practice https://github.com/torinstuartbrown/git_practice

        d. Push commit file to Github

        C:\Users\torin\CN\git_practice (master)
        λ git push --set-upstream practice master

        Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'practice'.

        C:\Users\torin\CN\git_practice (master -> practice)
        λ git push -u practice
        Everything up-to-date
        Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'practice'.
